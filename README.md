# AJAX Pagination
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ronalchn/ajax_pagination.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ronalchn/ajax_pagination)

[Wiki](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki) | [RDoc](http://rdoc.info/gems/ajax_pagination/frames) | [Changelog](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Handles AJAX pagination for you, by hooking up the links you want to load content with javascript in designated page containers. Each webpage can have multiple page containers, each with a different set of pagination links. The page containers can be nested. Degrades gracefully when javascript is disabled.

Basically, there is a helper function to use to create a section in your webpage, where content can be changed. Links can reference the section, and thus load new content into it.

For more, see [Introduction and Background](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Introduction-and-Background).

This gem currently assumes you are using Rails 3.1+, and the assets pipeline for the javascript and css files (see the Installation section). For Rails 3.0, see information below - adding support in progress.

## Installation with Asset Pipeline
Add to your Gemfile:

    gem 'ajax_pagination'

and run the bundle install command.

Then add to your asset manifests,

```js
// app/assets/javascripts/application.js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require history
//= require ajax_pagination
```

```css
/* app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
 *= require ajax_pagination
 */
```

## Installation on Rails 3.0, or without asset pipeline

To use this on Rails 3.0, or without using the assets pipeline, here is the [Installation without Assets Pipeline](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Installing-without-Pipeline) guide, and you must use the github version (in your Gemfile):

```rb
gem 'ajax_pagination', :git => "git://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination.git"
```

The generator for this has not yet been released to rubygems. Please notify me if it works in a Rails 3.0 application, before I release this to rubygems.

## Getting Started
To learn how to use this gem, read one of the usage guides below (found in the wiki):

* [Adding AJAX to will_paginate](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Adding-AJAX-to-will_paginate)
* [Adding AJAX to site navigation](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Adding-AJAX-to-site-navigation)

For more, including how specific features work, look in the [wiki](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Home).

Alternatively, to see the API, see [RDoc](http://rdoc.info/gems/ajax_pagination/frames).

## Features

* So easy to use, you don&#39;t need to touch a single line of javascript
* Supports multiple and nested sections
* Supports browser history, for more see [Robust Support for Browser History in AJAX Pagination](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Robust-Support-for-Browser-History-in-AJAX-Pagination)
* Supports links, but also POST, DELETE, PUT links and forms, which can all be used to change the content in a section
* Supports redirects - a necessary feature when used with forms
* Custom javascript events
* Built in visual cues when loading new content - can be altered with css.

## Example Application
This gem contains an example application (actually, it is there also for testing purposes), however it is nevertheless a good example.

Clone this repository, and run the server, using:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination.git
cd ajax_pagination
cd spec/rails_app
bundle install
bundle exec rails server
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:3000/

## Javascript Dependency
As well as the included ajax_pagination.js file, this gem uses jquery.ba-bbq.js and jquery.url.js, which are jquery plugins. They are included in the gem as assets already to simplify installation. ajax_pagination.js will automatically require jquery.ba-bbq.js, and jquery.url.js.

However, if you are already using them (especially if using a different version), simply ensure that your assets directory contains javascript files of the same name to shadow/override the file in the gem.

The other javascript dependencies rely on gems: jquery-rails, and jquery-historyjs. So if they are used, AJAX Pagination should play well with other gems using the libraries.

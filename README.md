# AJAX Pagination
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ronalchn/ajax_pagination.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ronalchn/ajax_pagination)

[Wiki](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki) | [RDoc](http://rdoc.info/gems/ajax_pagination/frames) | [Changelog](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Handles AJAX pagination for you, by hooking up the links you want to load content with javascript in designated page containers. Use this to ajaxify your site navigation. Degrades gracefully when javascript is disabled.

Each webpage can have multiple ajax_section containers, whether they are side by side, or even nested. Links can reference an ajax_section to load new content into the section using AJAX. Watch as the URL in the browser address bar updates, with fully working back/forward buttons.

For more, see [Introduction and Background](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Introduction-and-Background).

This gem requires Rails 3.0+. When using the asset pipeline in Rails 3.1+, follow the general installation instructions. Otherwise, use the ajax_pagination:assets generator, which puts the assets into the public/ directory.

It shows a built-in animation on loading, fully working history and AJAX requests which can perform POST and DELETE requests, whether via a link or a form submission and redirects.

## Installation
Assuming, you are using the asset pipeline, add to your Gemfile:

    gem 'ajax_pagination'

and run the bundle install command.

Then add ajax_pagination to your asset manifests,

```js
// app/assets/javascripts/application.js
//= require ajax_pagination
```

```css
/* app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
 *= require ajax_pagination
 */
```

To use this on Rails 3.0, or without using the asset pipeline, read the [Installation without the Asset Pipeline](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Installing-without-the-Asset-Pipeline) guide.

## Basic Usage
In the ActionView, use ajax_section to declare a section, and ajax_link_to to create a link loading content into the section:

```erb
<%= ajax_link_to "Link", link_url, :section_id => "section_name" %>
<%= ajax_section :id => "section_name", :render => "mypartial" %>
```

Then, in the ActionController, use ajax_respond to render only the partial when an AJAX request is made:

```ruby
Class ObjectsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    ...
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # index.html.erb
      ajax_respond format, :section_id => "section_name", :render => "_mypartial"
    end
  end
  ...
end
```

## Getting Started
To learn how to use this gem, read one of the usage guides below (found in the wiki):

* [Adding AJAX to will_paginate](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Adding-AJAX-to-will_paginate)
* [Adding AJAX to site navigation](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Adding-AJAX-to-site-navigation)

For more, including how specific features work, look in the [wiki](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Home).

Alternatively, to see the API, see [RDoc](http://rdoc.info/gems/ajax_pagination/frames).

## Features

* So easy to use, you don&#39;t need to touch a single line of javascript
* Supports multiple and nested sections
* Supports browser history, for more see [Robust Support for Browser History in AJAX Pagination](https://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination/wiki/Robust-Support-for-Browser-History-in-AJAX-Pagination)
* Supports links, but also POST, DELETE, PUT links and forms, which can all be used to change the content in a section
* Supports redirects - a necessary feature when used with forms
* Custom javascript events
* Built in visual cues when loading new content - can be altered with css.

## Example Application
This gem contains an example application (actually, it is there also for testing purposes), however it is nevertheless a good example.

Clone this repository, and run the server, using:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/ronalchn/ajax_pagination.git
cd ajax_pagination
cd spec/rails_app
bundle install
bundle exec rails server
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:3000/

## Javascript Dependency
As well as the included ajax_pagination.js file, this gem uses jquery.ba-bbq.js and jquery.url.js, which are jquery plugins. They are included in the gem as assets already to simplify installation. ajax_pagination.js will automatically require jquery.ba-bbq.js, and jquery.url.js.

However, if you are already using them (especially if using a different version), simply ensure that your assets directory contains javascript files of the same name to shadow/override the file in the gem.

The other javascript dependencies rely on gems: jquery-rails, and jquery-historyjs. So if they are used, AJAX Pagination should play well with other gems using the libraries.
